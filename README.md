# Moshi Moshi!!!
I'm AnantKun, from India. I'm a frontend developer and a high schooler. I do like reading and watching anime. I also tries to make something helpful because I want to develop projects which can help people to create something new from my open-source code. I always tries to learn something new.

# My Journey 
I first started coding in 2021. The first ever programming language that I have learnt is HTML. I learned HTML first because I'm fascinated with the web pages from which I used to download various games when I was a kid. <br> 
Basically, after learning HTML. I learnt Python. From python I started making some basic projects. My first ever python project was a snake game which I have made. I got suprised by the results and after then I created a multipurpose discord bot using python which can do some basic actions according to the given command.
